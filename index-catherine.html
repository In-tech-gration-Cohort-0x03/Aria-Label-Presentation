							# ARIA Labels

							1. What are they?
							2. Why are they used?

							---
							1. What are they?
							
							In short, ARIA Labels are tags used in Web Development. We add specific attributes
							HTML elements.
							---
							2. Why are they used?

							Nowadays, people of all ages, disabilities and technical background
							use the websites and apps in their everyday life. They also use
							numerous different devices, which themselves come with lots of capabilities.
							
							(assistive technologies like screen-reading)
							
							---

							ARIA Labels help developers improve accessibility, by making their websites
							look and feel more user-friendly. Thus, users of all backgrounds can easily
							use a page across multiple platforms with ease.

                <section data-markdown>
                    <textarea data-template>
							In this case, we will explain the Placeholder

							The <mark>*aria-placeholder*</mark> is an attribute
							used in textboxes or searchboxes to provide a hint
							to the users on what they need to input in the
							designated space.

                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>The code would be like this:</p>

                    <pre><code>
				<form>
					<p>
						<label for="comment">
							<span>Comment: </span>
							<input type="text" id="comment"
								name="comment"
								aria-placeholder="What are your thoughts?">
						</label>
					</p>
				</form>
			</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>And the result would be this:</p>

                    <form class="r-frame">
                        <p>
                            <label for="comment">
                                <span>Comment: </span>
                                <input type="textarea" id="comment" name="comment"
                                    aria-placeholder="What are your thoughts?" placeholder="What are your thoughts?">
                            </label>
                        </p>
                    </form>
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    <textarea data-template>
							**Caution** : While a thankful tool, this ARIA label
							can be confusing to the users, since the desired text
							only shows when the textbox is completely empty. If 
							for example there was a whitespace, the text would not
							show, thus confusing the user instead of helping.
						</textarea>
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    <textarea data-template>
							*Personal Opinion*

							*The most common and less error-prone use case of this
							ARIA label should be the searchboxes. If the user wants
							to search, they'll search regardless of the placeholder
							in question*
